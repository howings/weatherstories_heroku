Visual Design and API functions:
Finished the first wireframe in XD and will continue to adjust the locations and font sizes for the final version as a coding guide. Then, will move on to API code testing.
 
Front-End (React & React Bootstrap):
Victoria - Finished our first code review with React and React Bootstrap. Since we're still having issues with the json data file, we'll either wait to hear back from Wasim or move on to the SCSS code-only direction. 
 
Back-End (Node, Express, MongoDB or JSON):
Fiona -  Working on codes related to Express and will start coding the CRUD operations tomorrow. We also studied all of the MERN examples together about how to build a back-end with the MVC structure and tried understanding the MVVM structure for the front-end.
